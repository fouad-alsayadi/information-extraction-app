# Information Extraction App - Feature Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the planned feature implementations for the Information Extraction application, building upon the existing Job Details page foundation.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Schema Management Improvements
**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

#### Current State
- Basic schema listing and creation functionality
- Simple form-based schema definition

#### Planned Enhancements
- **Schema Validation**: Real-time validation of schema structure and field types
- **Schema Templates**: Pre-built templates for common document types (invoices, contracts, reports)
- **Schema Versioning**: Track changes and maintain version history
- **Schema Testing**: Test schemas against sample documents before deployment
- **Advanced Field Types**: Support for complex data types (arrays, nested objects, calculated fields)
- **Schema Import/Export**: Import schemas from JSON/YAML, export for backup
- **Field Mapping Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions for field mappings based on document content

#### Technical Requirements
- Backend: New schema validation endpoints
- Frontend: Enhanced schema builder UI with drag-and-drop
- Database: Schema version tracking tables
- Integration: MLflow for AI-powered suggestions
